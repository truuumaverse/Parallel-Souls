                    <p>hi!
this is my story about me and that one person i truly liked.
i'm writing this online because i don't have a book, and well… it's anonymous anyway. (until its not)

it all started around two and a half years ago, maybe more.
we were at someone's house working on a school project when i overheard my friends talking about her. i heard something heavier than concern. it unsettled me, but that's when something in me shifted.
i didn't feel pity. it was something deeper. she never asked for help, didn't seek attention, didn't beg for validation. maybe she just wanted a real friend. a place to belong.
and that's when i started falling not because she was vulnerable, but because despite everything, she kept going. she kept living.

maybe i fell for her because we were both stuck in the same dark chapter. but to be honest, i don't even remember exactly why i fell. i just know i did.
what i do remember is her voice, beautiful. she was into music, could sing, play guitar, keyboard, even started learning violin when we met. she was great at calligraphy, great at english, great at everything i wish i could be.
she reminded me of my first ever crush. so i promised myself that i won’t fumble this one. not again.

we got close after being groupmates again for a project of a "<span class="highlight">christmas lantern.</span>" she wasn’t in the group chat so i messaged her directly, and that's where our friendship started.
we started eating together during recess, laughing, talking, going home at the same time. one time after our christmas party, she didn't wanna go home yet, so we walked around.
we weren't even super close yet but i loved that moment.
we used to talked until midnight.

i introduced her to an online game. she got good at it while i eventually quit.
during grade 10? we had fun.

there was another time, we had a performance, and she needed to bring her instruments. 
it was raining. she had no service and lots to carry. even though we weren't talking much because of the awkwardness after i confessed, i still offered to help her. 
glad she accepted it. we both held the keyboard, walking in the rain with our umbrellas. we didn't talk. but that silence felt so full.
that magic hour during sunset with the dark shady sky but still has a ray of redder light scattered into the atmosphere. i'll never forget that walk to her house.  

and prom… i wasn’t really into it. but i asked her to dance in the most subtly, through instagram notes. i held her while she held me, and we danced, twice. she was the only one i danced with, and that was enough for me because thats all i want.
after that night, i gave her something important, a"<span class="highlight-guitar">guitar pick.</span>" i only had three. she got the best one. someone saw me give it to her, and yeah, i was happy. she also had a copy of our prom picture. i still have mine.
but then i still fumbled her.

after all of that, we didn’t end up together. she never saw me that way. and that broke me a bit. but she also changed me. helped me come out of my shell. made me better in a way. but it came at a cost.
i became the vulnerable one.

after a few months of not talking, just awkward silences, she was with someone else. maybe she lied when she said she didn’t see herself with anyone. but even if she did, i get it. i always do.
even now, i still check her socials. still wonder if she’s doing okay. i still talk about her to my friends, bragging. still see her the same way i did back in grade 10.
we don’t follow each other anymore, but we still watch each other’s stories and bios. like ghosts always there, just not really seen. and even now we/i still do.

and even though things didn’t turn out how i hoped, and we went our separate ways, some truths stayed with me.
we all know the truth but keep it hidden in our pockets.





                                             —this is where the story ends but

                                             
to the one still reading
i’m sure you know you’re the almost of this story.
all my feelings, from then until now, have been real.
i confessed once, but that didn’t mean i was ready to commit that time.
maybe there was a misunderstanding. i wanted to build something with you romantic or platonic, i cared deeply.
there’s so much left unsaid, but writing this leaves me silent.

though my heart still lingers, i need to let go.
two and a half years carrying longing, caring, and even shadows of anger
all in hopes of moving on, even when i couldn’t.
those efforts to be seen by you have worn me thin.
it’s time to clear spacefor myself, and for the ones i’m yet to meet.

this is where i say goodbye.
without hatred or regret,
only hope and peace.

pls be happy,
because i want to be, too.
